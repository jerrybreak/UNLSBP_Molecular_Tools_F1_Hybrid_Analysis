# DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

Analyzed_F1_data_single_crosses.csv - Output of script with counts of genotype calls and classification into "true hybrid" (H), "true self" (S) or inconclusive calls (?)

Hybrid_Genotypes.csv: Biallelic SNP genotype data from purported F1 hybrid plants obtained from genotyping with KASP molecular assays

Parental_Genotypes.csv: Biallelic SNP genotype data from parental lines used for artificial pollinations that gave rise to the purported F1 hybrids obtained from genotyping with KASP molecular assays

Polymorphic_SNPs.csv: File with information regarding SNP polymorphisms between two parents representing a hybrid

Script_for_analizing_F1_genotyping_results_V3.R: R script to run the analysis of genotype data and output "Analyzed_F1_data_Small_Set_For_ManuscriptSingle_crosses_(NEW_RUN).csv" above

All files were created in April 2025.



File relationship:

Hybrid_Genotypes.csv, Parental_Genotypes.csv and Polymorphic_SNPs.csv files are inputs for script (Script_for_analizing_F1_genotyping_results_V3.R).

Analyzed_F1_data_single_crosses.csv is the output of said script. 



# METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

The analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29) -- "Holding the Windsock"
Copyright (C) 2020 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)

The GUI used was RStudio
2024.12.1 Build 563

No additional packages other than the base packages and dev tools were installed. 

Genotype data was collected using KASP reactions that included KASP-TF V4.0 2X Master Mix 96/384, Standard ROX (2.5 mL) and a QuantStudioâ„¢ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System, 384-well, desktop instrument.
